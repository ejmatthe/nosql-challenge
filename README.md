## Part 1: Database and Jupyter Notebook Set Up

## Part 2: Update the Database

## Part 3: Exploratory Analysis
Before beginning to explore and analyze the data, I first altered the NoSQL_analysis_starter imports to include "import pandas as pd" to assist with creating dataframes. Additionally, for questions 1, 2 and 4, I split the cells apart to separate cells for converting into a Pandas Dataframe, print the number of documents found in the result, and printing the first 10 results. This provides the benefit of those results all displaying independently and at the same time.  
The questions I sought to answer were:  
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score equal to 20?
2. Which establishments in London have a RatingValue greater than or equal to 4?
3. What are the top 5 establishments with a RatingValue rating value of 5, sorted by lowest hygiene score, nearest to the new restaurant added, "Penang Flavours"?
4. 4. How many establishments in each Local Authority area have a hygiene score of 0?
